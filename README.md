# generator-npm

This package is deprecated, I was tired of maintain a use inspecific tool to
generate node packages, I was working on my own [generator-cattail](https://github.com/CatTail/generator-cattail).
Maybe in the future I will create a personal generator generator.

Anybody interest in this generator and require the namespace in npm, contact zhongchiyu@gmail.com

## Installation

    npm install -g generator-npm

## Usage

    yo npm
